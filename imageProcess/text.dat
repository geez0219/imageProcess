     20 Things You Should Insist on No Matter What People Say

Life can get pretty crazy at times. Sometimes we forget how important
it is to actually listen to ourselves instead of others. Happiness is
dependent upon ourselves, and there are some things in life you should
always insist on doing- no matter what others have to say about it.
Here is a list of 20 things you should always do.

1. Insist on chasing your dreams

To some people your dreams might sound far-fetched, completely
unobtainable, or downright silly. No matter what other people say to
you, always insist on following your dreams. If you give in, or
rather, give up on your dreams, you will never know what could have
happened. You only have one life to live, so you might as well give it
everything you've got. Forget the haters.

2. Insist on being the bigger person

All situations and arguments are not created equally. Being the bigger
person will ultimately make you feel better. Other people might
disagree and say you should have fought back, or whatever else you
should have done, but they don't have to live with the consequences.
Be the bigger person in life and move on. Trust me, you will be the
one who wins in the long run.

3. Insist on forgiveness

Forgiveness is not an easy thing. However, insisting on being
forgiving will make you a happier person. Once you forgive someone you
feel a weight that is lifted off your shoulders. Forgiving someone
doesn't mean you go back to the way things were before, but it does
mean letting yourself move on in a positive direction-and that's never
a bad thing.

4. Insist on seeing the glass half-full

Screw that glass-half-empty view. Positivity is a powerful thing. The
more positive a thinker you are, the more positive outcomes you will
see in your life. Keep those negative thoughts out, and those negative
people out too. There is almost always a bright side to a situation,
and focusing on that will help get you through.

5. Insist on staying true to yourself

No matter what other people say or do, you should always be true to
yourself. Throughout our lives people will try to shape our ideas, or
even try and get us to do things we don't believe in, which is why you
should always be true to yourself. Make decisions for yourself, and
never compromise who you are.

6. Insist on only being around those who make you a better or happier
person

Cut out those in your life that bring you down. Only surround yourself
with people who care about you just as much as you care about them.
Don't give in to being someone's fall back plan. It can be hard to cut
people from our lives, but it is also necessary. Surrounding yourself
with people who make you happy will only benefit your life.

7. Insist on learning from your mistakes

No matter what people say, you will make mistakes in your life. Life
is a learning process in itself. Some people will make you feel bad
about your mistakes, or insult you for making them. However, don't let
that stand in your way from learning from them. Accept your mistakes
fully and really figure out what went wrong. Knowledge is power.

8. Insist on sticking up for what you believe in

We will all be tested at some point in life to go against what we
believe in. Our morals are a strong part of who we are, and it is
important to stand up for what you believe. No matter what other
people say or try to influence you with, stand tall against them.

9. Insist on discarding all the drama from your life

When we are younger we all gossip and focus on the drama that goes on
in the world. Growing up we learn that drama isn't exactly as exciting
as we though it was. It brings us down and actually makes life more
difficult. It's time to grow up and cut out whoever and whatever drama
is taking over your life. Drama-free is the way to be!

10. Insist on letting go of the past

It's hard to let go of the past sometimes, but it can really be affect
your future. No matter what anyone has to say about it, insist on
letting go of your past and previous grudges, and focus on the here
and now. The past might have made you who you are, but the future
holds the power to change you into who you want to be. Let go and feel
the freedom that comes with it.

11. Insist on embracing change and creativity

A popular aphorism is,"You cannot solve a problem in the same state of
consciences that created it." Not everything can be solved in a
traditional way. Change and creativity are vital in today's world.
Things are always changing, so why should we be any different?
Embracing change will help you grow as a person, and bring you
opportunities that you would have otherwise missed out on. Creativity
allows your mind a chance to think differently and more freely. Don't
listen to what others say about how change is bad, instead make
something out of it.

12. Insist on paying it forward

Not everyone is as fortunate as you might be. Try to remember that
everyday. Take some time and give back to the community that you live
in. Giving back will boost your mood no matter what you are going
through. No matter what people might say to bring you down, just
remember that you have the power to brighten someones else's day.
Always pay it forward.

13. Insist on honesty

Being honest isn't always the easiest thing to do, but it is
definitely always the right thing to do. No matter what people say you
should always be honest with yourself and others. Being honest will
help you stay true to yourself, and you will be a better person for
it. Lies can get you caught up in bad situations, relationships, and
even cause inner conflict. It's best to always insist on honesty.

14. Insist on being dedicated

Today we see a lot of those get-rich-quick scheme and lose-100-pounds-
in-a-day pills. Things in life aren't always what they appear to be,
and we all know that. However, being dedicated to something will pay
off. Whether you are dedicated to getting healthy, following a dream,
or getting a better-paying job, we all know that time will be
involved. Good things don't just happen overnight, they take time and
effort. Insisting on putting your all into something and being
dedicated to the outcome you want will help you achieve your goals.

15. Insist on appreciating what you have

We can forget to take a step back and enjoy what we have in life. This
can take away from our happiness. Sometimes you just need to sit back
and be happy about where your life is right now, and what you have to
show for it. Sure people might tell you it's not good enough, but
don't listen to them. It is good enough, and it gives you a sense of
pride when you can enjoy the things you already have in life.

16. Insist on listening to your heart

Sometimes you just need to follow your instincts and do what your
heart tells you. There are some situations, like relationships, that
rely more on your heart than on your head. People will surely tell you
differently, but you should always insist on listening to what you
want and feel. Again, you are the one who lives with your choices, and
you are the one that has to live with  the "what ifs." Sometimes you
just have to follow your heart.

17. Insist on making time for yourself

We get so tied up in everything that's going on around us, and how
busy our schedules are, that we forget to make time for ourselves. No
matter how busy you are in your daily life, make sure to set some time
aside to focus on you. You deserve it.

18. Insist on kindness

Too many people experience being bullied. It's amazing what a small
act of kindness can do for someone. Make yourself a better person and
insist on being kind. You never know what someone else is going
through. Being kind will also keep you more grounded in life and more
positive. All these things have a positive impact on you.

19. Insist on living in the moment

In this crazy world we can all get caught up in everything except
what's happening in the moment. Take a step back and really enjoy the
memories you are making. It's nice to look back on picture of moments
you had in life, but its even better to remember how you felt in that
exact moment. Life your life to it's fullest and embrace the moments.

20. Insist on finding time for pleasure

I said it before, and I will say it again: we get so caught up in
everything around us that we forget to take a break-or even a breath
sometimes. No matter how busy you are make sure to find some time and
do something that you really enjoy. Whether that's catching up with a
good friend, reading a new book, or even watching your personal guilty
pleasure on TV, just make sure you make time for it. Life goes by way
too fast to not bring yourself some pleasure everyday.
